# California-Housing-Regression
A machine learning project of supervised regression technique to predict housing prices at California in the year of 1990.

> ###   a.	Context
As a real estate agency, deciding the right property prices can be challenging. On one side, if the price given by the seller is too high, it may resulting in the failure of selling the property. But, on the other side, real estate agents wanted to generate as much profit as possible. It can be very difficult to determine the right price both for the property agents and the potential customer. That is why property agency tends to use valuator to determine the valuation of a property, but it still led to a few problems, such as, the high cost of hiring and operational, the time it takes for the valuation will be days or even weeks, and the valuation result could even be bias or subjective due to the personal opinion or likeness. So machine learning based on real datasets can be proven benificial to lower future cost, valuation result within seconds (lower time taken), and due to its less prone to bias. 



> ###	b.	Problem Statement
Always hiring a valuator for each house can be costly, takes much more time (days or even weeks), and their valuation is also more prone to bias (subjective). It could also lead to inconsistency in the valuation result. Other than that, due to their incapabilities of handling large volumes of request in valuation, limited by human limitations and the man-power, it could slow down the real estate agency business chain. So, only relying on the manual valuator work could be proven harmful both in the short-term, and specifically on the long-term



> ###	c.	Goals
Based on the problems above, **Supervised Reggression** models will be used to make California house prices prediction that minimizes the residual. The goal is to develope a model which can predict house pricing without overfitting or underfitting. Using machine learning could give advantage in the business terms to simplify the work need to be done, and as well as the cost reduction.
